# About me

I'm **gominokouhai** or **pajh** or **Paj**, or pretty much anything you like really, including **Hey, you**.

I do some random code fuckery every now and again.

Currently teaching myself:
- Kotlin
- PHP
- Python
- GDScript
- inform 6
- Github itself

Yes, I have difficulty concentrating on one specific thing. But I'm having fun.

>Rubin, in some way that no one quite understands, is a master, a teacher, what the Japanese call a *sensei*. What he's the master of, really, is garbage, kipple, refuse, the sea of cast-off goods our century floats on. *Gomi no sensei*. Master of junk.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&ndash;William Gibson, *[The Winter Market](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Winter_Market)* [1985]
